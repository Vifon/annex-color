===========

Drop-in colorizers for Git Annex.

DISCLAIMER
----------

I'm still trying to figure out how to distribute my path colorizer
(and Python libraries in general) which these scripts use heavily. For
now they are just included in this repository. It's ugly but it works,
or so I think. Please bear with it for a while.
